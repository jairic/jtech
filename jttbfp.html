	<p id="p1">So this whole site was quite the learning experience. I had spent a great deal of time completing lessons on www.codecademy.com and through the Sololearn apps on my iPhone and was feeling quite confident. My expectation was that based on all of the knowledge that I had gained from the aforementioned endeavors I would be able to stand-up a website quite easily. I was wrong, and so learned a lot in building this site. I would say that the main thing that I am learning is what to use when. Sometimes it seems like using "margin" might be good, then I learn that float may be better, or something along those lines.</p>
